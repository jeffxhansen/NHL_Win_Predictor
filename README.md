This is an empty directory at the moment. I have added a .gitignore to ignore every single file in this directory, so if you absolutely want to make sure that something gets pushed to the GitHub, you will need to:
1. Open .gitignore
2. add `!data/your_file`
3. save the .gitignore
4. Do the normal git add your_file, git commit -m "message", git pull, git push

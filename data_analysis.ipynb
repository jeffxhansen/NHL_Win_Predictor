    "Before doing any exploration, consider when and how you plan on holding out data for model evaluation. The gold standard is to have totally independent data you have never seen before tucked away so you can evaluate model performance at the end, but there can be many reasons this may not work. Explain your choice. If you do want to hold out the same data every time, consider fixing a random seed when you make the test-train split."
